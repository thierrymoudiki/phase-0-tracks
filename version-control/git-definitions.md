# Git Definitions

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
- recording the changes made to a file or a set of files, so that specific versions can be recalled later
- it is useful because it allows to revert files back to a previous state, compare changes made to files over time, see who last modified something, etc.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
- And independent line of code, diverging from the main line 
- branches are useful because they allow to try new features on the project, without breaking the main line of development. The branch can then be merged with the main line of development. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
- A set of instructions describing the state of the project at a certain point in time 
- Present tense, concise. Describes the why, what, and where of the changes

* What is a merge conflict?
- it happens when same parts of the code are modified on two different branches. We have to tell Git how to merge the two branches together.
