# Git Definitions:

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
- Recording changes mades to a file or a set of files, so that specific versions can be recalled later. 
- Useful because it allows to revert files back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last 

modified something, etc.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
- An independent line of development, which diverges from the main one
- Allows to work on one or many different lines of development, without breaking the main line. The work made on branches can then be merged with the main line of development. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
- Set of instructions describing my code at a certain point in time
- Present tense, concise; describes the 'what', 'where' and 'why' of a new change

* What is a merge conflict?
- Happens when same parts of the code are modified on different branches, and we try to merge all the changes together in one branch
